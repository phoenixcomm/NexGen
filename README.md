NexGen
======

<p><b>NexGen Flight Simulator</b> is a model based which relies on standard protocols, such as, TCP/IP, NTP, etc., for inter-process communications. This is a mutli processor implantation, All of the APIs will be fully documented and open. The system will run only on a Linux or Unix systems. We can use almost what ever you with for your embedded processor as long as it has some form of communications.</p>
<p><b>NexGen</b> is not pilot centric, as most flight sims today. Instead you can model any aircraft with multiple crew station. So If you have a F-14 you have both the pilot and reo, if it's a B52 (BUFF) you need 5, if you really wanted a star ship Enterprise you need captain, helm, weapons, comm, science, medical, transporter and engineering. You would only have to change the Aircraft model, and the model of the world, like mars, or the Galaxy it really does not matter.</p>
